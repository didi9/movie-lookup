# Movie Lookup

## Getting Started  

Make sure that virtualenv, django and vue.js are installed on your machine (`pip install virtualenv`, `pip install django` and see [here]("https://cli.vuejs.org/") for instructions on vue.js)  

Clone this repository and run the following commands in order to set up the environment and run the server:
- `virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3 env`
- `source env/bin/activate`  
- `cd movielookup`  
- `python manage.py runserver`  

It should display a url that you can copy and paste into a browser. Enjoy searching movies to your hearts content!
